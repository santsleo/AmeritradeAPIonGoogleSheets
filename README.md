# Ameritrade API on GoogleSheets
An API wrapper for the TD Ameritrade API to import your accounts positions straight to a Google spreadsheet for further analysis and charting.

This is based upon @kohjb's code on: https://github.com/kohjb/AmeritradeAPIwGoogleScripts

I needed to analyze my positions so I created these functions, which combined with some =IMPORTHTML() helped achive an auto-updated portfolio analysis.
